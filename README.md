# Movie-Recommendation-system
This is a Content-based movie recommendation system, In this project I have created a 10k movie dataset using the TMDB API. After creating the dataset I performed data preprocessing on the dataset, then used NLP libraries like nltk, countVectorizer, etc. I have used cosine_similarity metrics to find the cosine distance between two features to calculate their similarity.
