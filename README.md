# Movie-Recommendation-system
In this project i have created 10k movies dataset using the TMDB API. After creating the dataset i have performed data preprocessing on the dataset, then used NLP libraries like nltk, countVectorizer etc. I have used cosin_similarity metrics to find the eucledian distance between two features to calculate their similarity.
